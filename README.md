## General info
This project, built using React and other related technologies, is the best example of teamwork you have ever seen. This is the frontend part of a full-stack project hosted on the Heroku service. All the data displayed here is obtained directly from the server, which we implemented in the backend part.

## Technologies
The following technologies were used to build this project:

* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Module CSS**: A method of writing CSS that scopes styles to specific components or modules.
* **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor that adds features like variables, mixins, and nesting to CSS.
* **BEM**: A naming convention for CSS classes that makes code more modular and easier to read.
* **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations.
* **JavaScript**: The programming language used to build the frontend logic.
* **React-Slick**: A library for building responsive, customizable carousels and sliders in React.
* **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine used for building the development environment.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a modern frontend application using React and related technologies. By using modular CSS techniques like module CSS and BEM, we can write CSS that is more maintainable and easier to read. TypeScript adds type safety to our code, which makes it easier to catch bugs during development. React-Slick allows us to build responsive, customizable carousels and sliders that work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
